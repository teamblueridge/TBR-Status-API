The Team BlueRidge Status API is a service that acts as a knocker to other services on a domain. It can verify both HTTP status codes as well as checking availability of TCP and UDP ports.

Visit [Team BlueRidge Status](https://status.teamblueridge.org) to see the API in action.

## Features

### JSON

Team BlueRidge Status API reports the status of these services to a JSON file, `autocheck.json`. This gets merged by the web back-end with `override.json`, generated by a command line script, with `override.json` taking precedence for any services in that file. The back-end then serves a JSON file to the requesting entity.

### Auto Check

Implementing a cron task to check the status of services allows you to constantly know the status of all services. Using a front-end app, you can have alerts come to you when one of your services goes down.

### Manual Override

Using the command line tool, you can override the status shown by the autocheck. This allows you to always have control of what is being reported to your users.
